            <p>I have always been self-driven and eager to learn. In the past these skills have helped me excel in sales and sales management roles. As I pivot from that career path to software development they have become even more valuable. I enjoy meeting new challenges head-on and love the constant challenge that learning a new programming language or framework offers. As an economist, I am a firm believer in efficiency and am always looking for ways to refactor my code to make it more efficient. In a similar regard, I am always looking for ways to improve the processes that I build around my learning practices. I know that by focusing on the process and getting better each and every day, opportunities are endless. I am beyond excited to continue my growth as I move from Turing to the workforce. I look forward most to the new challenges, the opportunity to help others and the platform to contribute to my community. </p>
